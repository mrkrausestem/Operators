 ## App Exercise - Complex Average Calculations
 
 >It is expected that you combine these calculations into one line.
 
 You calculated an average quiz score to display to the user. However, using proper order of operations you can do this in fewer steps. Create three separate quiz scores, all of type `Double`, with values between 60 and 100. Then create a constant equal to the average quiz score. If you use correct order of operations you can do the calculation in one line.

/*:
 Another important topic to cover in the app is unit conversions. Create a constant `tempInFahrenheit` equal to 98.6.
 
 You may want to also show the temperature in celsius. You can convert fahrenheit to celsius by taking `tempInFahrenheit` and subtracting 32, then multiplying the result by (5.0/9.0). Create a constant `tempInCelsius` that calculates in one line the temperature in celsius.
