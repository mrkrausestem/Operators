/*:
 ## App Exercise - Counting
 
 The most basic feature of your math tutoring app is counting the number of questions attempted. Create a variable `questionsCount` and set it equal to 50. Then increment its value by 1 to simulate a user attempting a question. (.25 points)
 */


/*:
 In addition to tracking questions attempted, your fitness tracking app tracks the number of correct answers. Create a variable `questionsCorrect` of type `Int` and set it equal to 46. This will represent the user having gotten 46 questions correct.
 
 You decide, however, to display the total number of points accumulated. 1 question is worth 3 points. Use a compound assignment operator to convert `questionsCorrect` to points. Print the result. (.50 points)
